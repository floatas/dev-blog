<p>I could compare this experience to buying 34 inch ultra wide curved monitor - you don't really notice it, just feels natural. I usually drive on 4-6 gear with 50% assist, I have to pedal, and it's not super easy, but at the same time I'm always going +24 kmh. </p>

<p>Mine came with a mud protector.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gears and assist</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>1 - 6 gear + assist = +20kmh, three assist modes 25%, 50%, 75% and full throttle. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fiido D4S vs Ninebot Segway Max G30</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>similar price, similar specs - comparison</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Fiido D4S 20 kmh speed is quite normal, but for Ninebot and scooters in general 20km is on the lower side. On straight roads, it might be harder to keep high speeds and Ninebot will be ahead, but on roads with corners, Fiido wins.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unlocking full speed</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There is a number of videos and tutorials on how to unlock an additional power, it's not a dramatic improvement, but it's something. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Turn the bike off, full throttle, press both brakes and turn the bike on - wait until the error message appears and release throttle and brakes. Do it again and you will toggle it again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ride history</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I kept a log every time I charged the bike with some notes about the ride. All my rides are on 4-6th gear with 50-75% assist.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>25% is not that noticeable, and gears from 1 to 3 are kind of worthless when using 50 - 75 % assist. You only need to pedal a few times and then your legs just wobble in the air without any resistance. And once the bike starts to use electric power, you need to pedal once in a while to notify him that you still want to go further, otherwise, the electric assist will turn off, at this point, it's more comfortable to just use the throttle.</p>

<p>I wanted to discharge the battery completely, but when the battery gets empty, the indicator starts to blink and the throttle is almost gone, a small assist is still there. I'm not sure how long you can drive with a blinking battery indicator, but at that point, it's mostly only you. The headlight stays on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Car trunk-test</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I drive Volvo S80, the trunk is big enough for a folded bike and Ninebot scooter, and there is still room for some bags. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Notes from bike service</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Misaligned breaks, highest and lowest gears were a bit hard to get sometimes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Breaks - these bikes are not the highest quality, and break holders are welded at a small angle, which leads to breaks not connecting properly, some adjustments can be done, but it will never be perfect.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Gears - for this bike, Shimano is more for a name, not quality. The smaller gear shifter wears faster and is not powerful enough to shift fast. Slow down pedaling and hold shift up handle for 1 second to fully and easy shift.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things that I miss</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Handle for carrying - the bike is small and can be easily folded, but it would be great to have some handles for carrying.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Ignition key - right now you just need to press a button and you are ready to go. Since this bike is not that cheap, an ignition key or some other protection would be nice.</li>
