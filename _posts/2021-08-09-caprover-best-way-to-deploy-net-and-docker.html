<p>Caprover quickly became my favorite server management tool. If you are a solo developer or working in a smaller team, you should definitely give it a try.</p>

<h3>What's included:</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Docker registry - but you can easily connect to any other registry</li>
<li>Docker build engine - just push your code and Caprover will build and deploy it</li>
<li>Webhooks - integrate with any Git repository and build\deploy on push</li>
<li>Server metrics</li>
<li>Lets Encrypt certificates - Caprover will issue and renew certificates for you</li>
<li>Custom nginx configs - you are not locked in doing things in only one way, if you need web sockets or extra http headers - you can modify configuration</li>
<li>One-click-apps - select app from list, enter required variables (name, version ...) and deploy. Similar to  docker-compose where you can run multiple services from single configuration. Also it's easy to create your own one-click-app configurations</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's missing</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Logging - to view nginx or other service logs you have to SSH to server</li>
<li>No build steps - you can't run tests or do anything else, just build and push to registry</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been using Caprover for a half year now and moved all my services to it, so right now I have +10 services running, including web apps, databases, WordPress, and more.</p>

<p>Caprover is too simple to write about and its documentation covers all the details, but at the same time Caprover is too important not to mention it.</p>
